# 3rd Java Project

Project 3 is a grade adjuster.  The user supplies the program with a grade, and you can curve it different ways. 
This project focused mainly on implementing methods into a program.  It also focused on using different kinds of loops.

This project was done for my first Intro to Computer Science class.
